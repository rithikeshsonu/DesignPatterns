## 🎯 LINQ Concepts Covered

### 🔰 Level 1: Basic Operations
- Filtering with `Where`
- Projection with `Select`
- Aggregates (`Sum`, `Count`, `Min`, `Max`)
- Sorting (`OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`)
- Other operations: `Distinct`, `Any`, `All`, `First`, `Take`, `Skip`
- String operations
- Set operations (`Intersect`, `Union`, `Except`)

### 👨‍🎓 Level 2: Object Operations
Working with `List<Student>`:
- Filter students by marks
- Project student names
- Sorting by marks
- Grouping (pass/fail, marks)
- Finding highest scorer
- Aggregations (average, count)
- Transformations (uppercase names)
- Distinct values

### 🚀 Level 3: Advanced Scenarios
- Top N students
- Second highest scorer
- Joins between collections
- Grouping by name initials
- Anonymous types
- Finding elements by conditions
- Chunking and pagination
- Nested collection handling

### 🧠 Level 4: Tricky Problems
- List reversal
- Dictionary conversion
- Safe element access
- Frequency counting
- List comparison
- Duplicate detection
- String operations (longest word)
- CSV generation

## 💻 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio or VS Code
3. Explore the `Program.cs` file
4. Run examples and experiment with modifications
